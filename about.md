Welcome! My name is Vinay Jain, and this is my blog about software development. I live in Pune, India and I develop iOS applications. I also like Python and I use it to automate the digital tasks, not all tasks can be automated ;)

On this blog, I like to write about my learnings as a developer for the iOS platform and for Python as well. Apart from iOS and Python you can expect some posts about my experiences and learnings from the IT industry.
