### Hardware


- [MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)](https://www.amazon.in/Apple-MacBook-Pro-9th-Generation-Intel-Core-i7/dp/B07SBK1YHJ/) thanks to Gojek ðŸ˜‰

- [iPhone 6 128gb](https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-6-Silver-128GB/dp/B00O4WU01O) bought it in 2015, desperately need an upgrade but I still love it because of its small size and great display.

- [Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro](https://www.flipkart.com/redmi-note-5-pro-blue-64-gb/p/itmf2fc3vuz27hyf?pid=MOBF2BSGJYHPWE6N&lid=LSTMOBF2BSGJYHPWE6NTLHOCW&marketplace=FLIPKART&sattr[]=color&sattr[]=ram&st=color). Secondary phone. Don't want to spend too much on an Android phone.

- [Nikon D5300](https://www.amazon.in/Nikon-24-2MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6g/dp/B00JM4VE0A) only thing stopping me from an iPhone upgrade. Coupled it with a [Nikon 50mm 1.8G](https://www.amazon.in/Nikon-AF-S-NIKKOR-50mm-Focus/dp/B071NTPMPL/) the nifty fifty.

- [UE Megablast](https://www.amazon.in/Ultimate-Megablast-Waterproof-Hands-free-984-000911/dp/B075WKS4D8/) absolutely love it. A bluetooth speaker which I have taken inside a swimming pool ðŸ˜ƒ

- [Google Nest Mini](https://store.google.com/in/product/google_nest_mini) won it in a lucky draw by <a href="https://cred.onelink.me/spQx/13a4a349" target="_blank"> Cred</a>. Had spent 28000 reward points for this.
