I"n<p>Whenever we declare properties in Objective-C there are some keywords between the parentheses like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strong</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weak</code>,  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atomic</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nonatomic</code>. There can be multiple comma separated words in between the parentheses, sometimes we don’t add any keywords there and keep the default compiler behavior. In this post we’ll discuss what these keywords/attributes actually mean and what are the effects of using one over the other. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@property</code> are specific to Objective-C but the concepts can be applied to Swift as well, if you are a Swift only dev I still recommend going through this post once.</p>
