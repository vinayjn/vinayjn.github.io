I"<p>My favorite thing in frontend development is building custom user interfaces. It keeps challenging creativity and tests my eye for detail. Most of the times user interfaces give you instant feedback on what works and what doesn’t, based on these feedbacks you keep making changes which further improve the user experience. However, making these changes everytime isn’t easy, very often we hit roadblocks because of the limited functionality or maybe restricted API access. Situations like these pushes you to discover new ways of doing the same thing. As a software engineer you can do so by either browsing Stackoverflow or reading documentation or using your imagination and creativity. One recent encounter of this kind was drawing a dotted line between two points in iOS.</p>
