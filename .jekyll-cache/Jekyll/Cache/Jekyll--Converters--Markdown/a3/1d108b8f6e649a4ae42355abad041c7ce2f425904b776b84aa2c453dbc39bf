I"P<p>It has only been three years of my professional career and so much has changed since I started. I have gained as well as lost. I had the opportunity to live in three different cities but consequently had to leave some amazing and beautiful people behind. My career demanded to switch two employers serving 1 year to each. These employers didn’t just pay me well but appreciated and recognized my work. I learnt a lot, I had great colleagues who helped and encouraged me in hard times. I made some great friends and I’ll never forget them and I hope they don’t forget me as well.</p>
