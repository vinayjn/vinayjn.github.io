I"Þ<p>When I was in college I used to teach school students Mathematics and Physics, which still are my favorite subjects. I also presented a few tech related topics in my college to help my friends understand them better. I enjoy teaching, itâ€™s fun and it is always a good learning exercise for me as well. It gives an entirely different perspective to learning and being on the other side makes me feel more confident of the things I already know. But after I graduated and started working in the software industry I didnâ€™t get enough opportunities and couldnâ€™t find time to do it. I attended tech meetups and thought of presenting a few topics but couldnâ€™t, for me preparing a presentation was a herculean task that time.</p>
