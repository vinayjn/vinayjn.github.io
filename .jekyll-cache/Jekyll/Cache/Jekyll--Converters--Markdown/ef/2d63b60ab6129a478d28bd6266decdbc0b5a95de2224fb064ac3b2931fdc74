I"˜<p>At the time of this writing I am 23 years 7 months 25 days old and for the last 3 years, since the day I owned my first smartphone, I am engrossed with my phone and desktop notifications. Iâ€™ve been trying to get away from screens but Iâ€™m addicted to all of my devices. I realize that Iâ€™m always online and I never cut-off from internet. Even when Iâ€™m accompanied by people I enjoy talking to Iâ€™m actively listening to my phone tunes and vibrations. I was using my phone every where, at the coffee shop, at the restaurants, in office working hours and also in the washroom. I stopped going out on weekends and preferred to watch movies and TV series at home on my laptop. I stayed awake late nights cutting-off 2-3 hrs of precious sleep just to watch some interesting YouTube videos in the dimmest possible screen brightness. I hurt my eyes every night because the dimmest brightness is still too bright in the dark. My devices started owning me and I loved them over anything. The high possession of devices has stopped me from engaging in concrete and meaningful discussions. I almost lost my conversing skills and Iâ€™m glad I realized it â€“ not too late.</p>
