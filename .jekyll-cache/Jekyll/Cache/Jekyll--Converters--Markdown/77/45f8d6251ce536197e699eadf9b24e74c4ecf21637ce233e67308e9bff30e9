I"<p>Today is Sunday, 21 Dec 2014, the time is 03:23 AM. Temperature in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pune</code> this time is about 6 - 7 °C. This is relatively a cold night and it is always easy to fall asleep in winter. But wait, I am standing in the balcony because I couldn’t sleep, I was having random thoughts which in turn made new thoughts.</p>

<p>As I can’t just stand in the balcony, I checked almost every social networking apps on my phone.</p>

<p>Found <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Nothing</code> interesting.</p>

<p>Why not channelize these random thoughts towards programming. Oh yeah!! why not crawl <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> and try fetching information/pictures from public profiles.</p>

<h6 id="crawling-instagram">Crawling Instagram</h6>

<p>At first thought I found it very easier to fetch URL’s from insta profiles, and for profiles having less number of photos (20-30) it came out to be true. What I found challenging was fetching URLs from profiles which have many photos.</p>

<p>On the desktop version of Instagram’s site you need to scroll the page to body height to load the next page of photos, as we see in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Facebook</code></a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">News Feed</code>. Being a beginner in crawling it was very difficult for me to execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Python</code> and that also not on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web browser</code>. Scratching my head for a few seconds activated my neurons and the nervous system responded with a name Selenium. I had some previous knowldege of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Selenium </code> webdriver, using it one can automate a browser(how cool is that). I searched for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Python</code> based selenium module. a quick <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Google</a> searched helped me. I was fortunate that I landed on this link <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/">Selenium with Python</a>.</p>

<p>A few more minutes spent in the integration of Selenium webdriver added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instacrawl.py</code> to my list of Crawlers.</p>

<h6 id="where-is-the-source-">Where is the source ?</h6>

<p>There are already so many Instagram crawlers/downloaders available, which are far better than mine. The only reason I feel mine is better is that its written by me.</p>

<p><strong>End Notes :</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Selenium WebDriver makes your program slow.</li>
  <li>Sorry Instagram.</li>
