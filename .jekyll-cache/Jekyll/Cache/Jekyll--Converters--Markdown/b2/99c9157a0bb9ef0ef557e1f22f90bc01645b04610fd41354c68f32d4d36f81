I"û<p>At the time of this writing I am 23 years 7 months 25 days old and for the last 3 years, since the day I owned my first smartphone, I am engrossed with my phone and desktop notifications. Iâ€™ve been trying to get away from screens but Iâ€™m addicted to all of my devices. I realize that Iâ€™m always online and I never cut-off from internet. Even when Iâ€™m accompanied by people I enjoy talking to Iâ€™m actively listening to my phone tunes and vibrations. I was using my phone every where, at the coffee shop, at the restaurants, in office working hours and also in the washroom. I stopped going out on weekends and preferred to watch movies and TV series at home on my laptop. I stayed awake late nights cutting-off 2-3 hrs of precious sleep just to watch some interesting YouTube videos in the dimmest possible screen brightness. I hurt my eyes every night because the dimmest brightness is still too bright in the dark. My devices started owning me and I loved them over anything. The high possession of devices has stopped me from engaging in concrete and meaningful discussions. I almost lost my conversing skills and Iâ€™m glad I realized it â€“ not too late.</p>

This post isnâ€™t about saying how bad technology is. I love technology and knowing about technology and its advancements has always helped me move ahead of the crowd. Iâ€™m just putting a limit on its usage and trying to think more about how beautiful my life can be just 4.7 inches above that phone screen.</p>

<p>Earlier in the previous month I was at my friendâ€™s place visiting a house party. We were sitting there talking, and I felt my phone vibration. At that moment I tried being in the conversation but I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about what the notification could be, what couldâ€™ve changed in the world for which I am notified. And my friends were able to see that I am not actually listening to them, I was in an another world. I felt bad and I knew that I missed the joy of being with my friends. There I was able to conclude â€“ Thatâ€™s not an issue with notifications, thatâ€™s an issue with self control.</p>

<p>Last week I went for dinner with one of my mentors in a nearby restaurant â€“ nothing fancy. As we reach our table the first thing I did was turn off my phone and put it in my pocket so that there were no distractions that could take me out of any discussions happening in the future.</p>

<p>It was awesome. I was deeply engaged in the conversation. I listened to each and every word he said, it was one of the best discussions in my recent memory. Being his mentee I talked to him about my notifications syndrome and got acceptable suggestions. This meeting and my actions in it has brought some changes in me in a very short period of time. I am getting away from my devices, instead of reading ebooks I purchase hardcopies. I watched a movie with my friends in theatre. Instead of chatting on the phone I prefer to make calls which saves me a lot of time. Whenever I take coffee breaks in office hours I leave my phone at my desk on silent mode so that it doesnâ€™t disturb someone else. I have also uninstalled some useless apps which were just killing my time and kept only the productive ones, well exceptions are always there.</p>

<p>I cannot say what effects technology has on you, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with technology. It has productive usecases in any situation you could name but what we do with it is waste of time and capabilities. Thereâ€™s got to be a limit on itâ€™s usage and Iâ€™ve started drawing one.</p>
